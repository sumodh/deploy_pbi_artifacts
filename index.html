        <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        The Capstone project takes a scenario-based approach simulating the
        demands of a real business environment requiring proficiency in the
        techniques learned throughout the professional certificate.
      </p>
      <h3>The Situation</h3>
      <p>
        As a Business Analyst working for ‘Tailwind traders’, a fictional
        company, I was supposed to create an executive dashboard that is
        mobile-friendly and displays:<br />
        • Sales summaries on product quantities and median sales trends.<br />
        • Profit metrics such as net revenue and yearly profit margin by
        country.<br />
        • Card visualisations for quick insight
      </p>
      <h3>The Brief</h3>

      <p>
        I was given a collection of excel files containing sales, purchase and
        countries records, and I also used a simple python code to read data on
        Currency exchange rate and create a data frame.<br />
        My goal was to use Power BI and DAX to design, build and deploy reports
        and dashboards to share across the organisation.
      </p>
      <h3>The Objectives</h3>
        • Prepare the data. <br/>• Model the data.<br/> • Create model calculations using
        DAX and optimize model performance.<br/> • Create dashboard & reports for
        usability, storytelling, and identifying patterns and trends
        <br/>•Configuring alerts <br/>• Deploy and maintain Deliverables
      </p>

      <h2>Data Prep</h2>
      <h3>Data Preparation in Excel</h3>
      <p>The sales data in excel was prepared to ensure accuracy and for loading into power BI. Additionally, Gross Revenue, total tax and net revenue columns were calculated.

      </p>
      <h3>Data Profiling</h3>
      <p>Sales, Purchases, Countries and historical currency exchange data were loaded into Power BI. Data profiling was done to identify data anomalies, examining data structures and interrogating column properties and statistics. </p>

      <h3>Design and Develop data model</h3>
      <p>
        New tables, Calendar and Sales in USD were created in the query editor and the relationships among the tables were defined.
      </p>

      <h3>Calculation of Financial Measures Using DAX</h3>
      <p>Financial measures were calculated for the assessment of the financial performance of the company.
